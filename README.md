# Student-Depression-2025

This is my **first data analysis project** utilizing GitHub. My primary objective is not only to analyze the data but also to **apply and consolidate the foundational data science concepts** I have been learning over the past few months. I am also using this project as a study platform to master the GitHub workflow.

## ðŸŽ¯ Study Objectives

This project focuses on the following learning goals:

* **Data Manipulation:** Practice importing, cleaning, and manipulating data using the **Pandas** library.
* **Data Visualization:** Build clear and informative graphs using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
* **Version Control:** Understand and consistently apply the **commit** and **push** workflow on the GitHub platform.

* ## ðŸ’¾ Data Source

* **Source:** Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/taincichin/depression-student)
* **Status:** Work in Progress. I will be updating this section with key insights as the analysis progresses.
